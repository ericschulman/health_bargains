# First test: linear demand case. 
# We define market share $s_i$ to proceed this way. With linear demand, we have the Hotelling model solution. We include the price here, since price is rather easy to find in closed form in this linear case. However, when we move to logit, this is no longer the case. I let insurer 1 correspond to insurer i, and insurer 2 correspond to insurer j without loss.

p1 = Symbol('p1', real = True)
p2 = Symbol('p2', real = True)
# Since we already have the optimal prices in closed form, the inclusion of p1 and p2 as symbols isn't entirely necessary. This approach is simply for generality for the logit case. 
def optimalPrice1(Phi1, Phi2, lambda1):
    return (2 * Phi1 + Phi2) / 3 + lambda1 #this avoids symbolic issues, since these are now arguments of NUMBERS and manipulates them that way rather than "relational" issues with symbols
def optimalPrice2(Phi1, Phi2, lambda1):
    return (2 * Phi2 + Phi1)/ 3 + lambda1
# can then find optimum without needing to differentiate, by using an optimize/maximize command
marketshareLinear1 = (1 + (1 / lambda1) * (optimalPrice2 - optimalPrice1)) / 2 #(p2 - p1)) / 2 would be the case used for logit, since we haven't determined p1 or p2 in that case. 
marketshareLinear2 = (1 + (1 / lambda1) * (optimalPrice1 - optimalPrice2)) / 2 #(p1 - p2)) / 2
# Defining profit functions for insurers  1 ($i$) and 2 ($j$), and the hospital $h$. 
profitInsurer1 = marketshareLinear1 * (optimalPrice1 - Phi1)
profitInsurer2 = marketshareLinear2 * (optimalPrice2 - Phi2)
profitHospital = (Phi1 - costH) * marketshareLinear1 + (Phi2 - costH) * marketshareLinear2
# Maximizing these profit functions for insurers leads to the optimal price selection $p1$ and $p2$ in terms of $Phi1$ and $Phi2$. This gives us expressions in terms of $Phi1$ and $Phi2$ to plug into the NiN bargaining function in the next section. This isn't entirely necessary in the linear case, since we already have closed form expressions in the form of optimalPrice1 and optimalPrice 2, but this should work great for the logit case in an approach similar to the one detailed below. 

# Defining disagreement function $\Pi_h(\mathcal{G}\setminus i)$ before proceeding to NiN. I begin with the case of zero recapture, passive beliefs. Namely, if there is a disagreement, the other hospital only captures the market share they previously anticipated.

# I think that the issue that I'm having as to why this won't compile stems from the fact that I'm using symbolic characters (Phi1, Phi2) and trying to work with them, instead of having them as "variables." I'm not sure how to include these otherwise, though. I'll comment everything above out, and manually enter everything using the "element" aspect, which is certainly tedious, but perhaps necessary.

# "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()" is my compiling error. I'm not sure how to account for multiple solutions with this format, since the previous setting I worked with this, there was a singular solution (or, at least, when I plotted best-responses, intersections corresponded to solutions.) This may be the wrong approach. I'm not entirely certain just yet. 

# An alternative approach would be to apply the first-order approach to the previous case, rather than opting to try to use the plotting approach. The issue of multiplicity of solutions is ruled out, since it will provide the vector of solutions if there exist multiple.
